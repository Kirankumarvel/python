# Program to demonstrate numeric constants, string constants, and explain the use of constants in Python

# Numeric Constants
# Integer Constant
print(123)  # Output: 123

# Floating-Point Constant
print(98.6)  # Output: 98.6

# String Constants
# Single-Quoted String
print('Hello world')  # Output: Hello world

# Double-Quoted String
print("Hello world")  # Output: Hello world

# Explanation of Constants
print("\nExplanation of Constants:")
print("Numeric constants are straightforward and represent numbers. They can be integers or floating-point numbers.")
print("Integer Constant Example: print(123) -> Output: 123")
print("Floating-Point Constant Example: print(98.6) -> Output: 98.6")

print("\nString constants are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes (') or double quotes (\").")
print("Single-Quoted String Example: print('Hello world') -> Output: Hello world")
print('Double-Quoted String Example: print("Hello world") -> Output: Hello world')

print("\nWhy Use Constants?")
print("Constants are useful because they provide a way to use fixed values in your code without changing them.")
print("This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.")
print("For example, if you have a value that should not change, using a constant ensures that it remains the same throughout the program.")

print("\nExamples in Detail:")
print("Printing an Integer Constant:")
print("  print(123)")
print("Explanation: This line of code prints the integer 123 to the console. The value 123 is a constant because it does not change.")

print("\nPrinting a Floating-Point Constant:")
print("  print(98.6)")
print("Explanation: This line of code prints the floating-point number 98.6 to the console. The value 98.6 is a constant.")

print("\nPrinting a String Constant with Single Quotes:")
print("  print('Hello world')")
print("Explanation: This line of code prints the string Hello world to the console. The string is enclosed in single quotes, making it a string constant.")

print("\nPrinting a String Constant with Double Quotes:")
print('  print("Hello world")')
print("Explanation: This line of code prints the string Hello world to the console. The string is enclosed in double quotes, making it a string constant.")
